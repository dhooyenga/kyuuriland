<h1>How To Not Ruin Your Deck Of Cards Against Humanity With Your Own Poorly Written, Bad Ideas</h1>

<p>It takes a a lot of hard work to polish the turds in our game to such a high sheen. Ech card in Cards Agains Humanity makes it through several rounds of debate and playtesting. This guide contains some of our best tricks and advice for writing good cards that won’t ruin your game.</p>

<h2>Do.</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Be specific.</strong> If you write a card about cutting of a flamingo’s legs, how are you going to do it? The answer is <em>“with garden shears.”</em></li>
<li><strong>Give the card a point of view</strong> If you’re writing a card about your dad, show us how you feel about your dad. <em>“My dad.”</em> doesn’t tell us how you feel, but <em>“My dad’s dumb fucking face.”</em> does.</li>
<li><strong>Write with a voice.</strong> Cards work best when they set the scene, even one as simple as <em>“Man, this is bullshit. Fuck ______.”</em> It’s a little snapshot of a person’s life.</li>
<li><strong>Test the card.</strong> Seriously. If it’s a white card, try it out with some black cards. If it’s a black card, try it out with some white cards. If the card makes people sad or they don’t laugh at it, cut it.</li>
<li><strong>Write clearly.</strong> Eliminate words that don’t contribute to the heart of the joke. <em>“A moment of silence.”</em> is less funny and powerful than <em>“Silence.”</em></li>
<li><strong>Tell a story.</strong> Good black cards reveal a hidden aspect of the white cards in your hand. What do the white cards smell like? How might the white cards have gotten into your butt? Good white cards participate in the narrative of the black cards.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Don’t.</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Don’t just go for shock value.</strong> A card is not funny just because it’s offensive. It also has to be funny.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t try too hard.</strong> Nine times out of ten, <em>“Clams.”</em> will play funnier than <em>“A huge barrel of exploding blood clams.”</em></li>
<li><strong>Don’t write a stand-up routine.</strong> A card is not a complete joke. It is half of a joke.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t break the rules of grammar.</strong> Black cards that have adjectives before the blank (like <em>“smelly ______”</em>) or articles before the blank (like <em>“the ______”</em>) don’t work.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t write cards with totally invented concepts or references.</strong> This confuses the simpleminded.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t make jokes about pirates, ninjas, zombies, or unicorns.</strong> Make jokes sparingly about robots. <em>Note:</em> There can never be too many jokes about wizards.</li>
<li>If all of that seems like too much for you to handle, a good alternative would be <strong>throwing this pack in the garbage and walking into the ocean.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>One last piece of advice: write cards with friends. Nothing in Cards Against Humanity was written alone.</p>

<p>Good luck, and keep polishing those turds.</p>
